# Team 1257 Scouting App: 2019
This app, by FRC Team 1257 (Parallel Universe) is meant to be used for scouting for the 2019 FRC game of Destination: Deep Space.

Feel free to download on an Android device running Android 5.0 or higher (we use six of them - one for each robot). If you're from another team and are looking to use our scouting system for future competitions, reach out to me (on Discord or CD) rather than just downloading the app - the app will send scouting data directly to our spreadsheet. If you reach out to me, we can duplicate our scouting sheets for you to use, which will generate new IDs for sending objective and pit data, which you can update in Settings (as of right now, the default IDs are set to our own spreadsheet).

This is the latest version (V11) of the app, which has everything but built-in Bluetooth sending (which is necessary for sending data at competition without internet access - we have used a different app for this but are trying to integrate it into this one for simplicity), which will probably be in the next version of the app. However, V11 works for scouting matches as long as the Android device is connected to the internet.

UPDATE 06/21: V12 is up!
